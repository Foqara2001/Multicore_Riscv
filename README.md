# Multicore RISC-V Processor (in progress...)
# 📖 Overview
A multicore RISC-V processor implementation written in SystemVerilog/Verilog, featuring a multi-core architecture with shared memory and inter-core communication capabilities. This project implements a scalable processor design that can be configured with multiple RISC-V cores working in parallel.

# ✨ Features
Multi-core Architecture: Configurable number of RISC-V cores

RISC-V ISA Support: Implements base RISC-V instruction set

Shared Memory System: Interconnected memory architecture for core communication

Inter-core Communication: Mechanisms for data sharing and synchronization between cores

SystemVerilog Implementation: Modern HDL design with modular components

Configurable Core Count: Easily adjustable number of processing cores
